Rotting Apartment Hall 1 [A]
The walls are decaying, and there is a sickening drone coming from the vents. The lights are busted, and you can only make out doors to the left and the right.
Dim Cabin
A poorly lit cabin. It is hard to see in here, so you should double check any compartments.
Bloodied Cabin
Red drag marks cover the floor of the cabin as cold air blows in from the broken window. The torn sheets and upturned furniture likely provide little to no comfort.
Cliffside Outlook Tower
A fairly spacious outlook tower for spotting fires. The tables are littered with observational equipment.
Hoarder's Cabin
The living quarters of a kleptomaniac. Many of the compartments are unable to be closed due to the amount of objects stored within them.
