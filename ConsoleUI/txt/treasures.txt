$10 Bill
Not much, but you can get a ton from a vending machine.
Fancy Wrist Watch
A wrist watch with gold inlay. Found on the street, and was planning on cleaning it up and pawning it. However, it could make for a killer gift.
Glasses
Never wear them but the frame is cool. That counts for something, I guess.
