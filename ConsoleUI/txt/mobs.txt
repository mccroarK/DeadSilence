Bird
Not sure if it is a bird, but I can hear something fluttering in the attic.
Deer Trophy
Not really living, but could be helpful if I need something to talk to.
Mouse
Skittering inside the walls.
Spider
In the corner of the bedroom. Does not look poisonous, but I don't take chances.
Thing at the Foot of My Bed
In my dreams, there is a thing at the foot of my bed. I have never seen his face, but I feel like I know who he is.
